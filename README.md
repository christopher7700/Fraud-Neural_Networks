# Fraud-Classification-with-Neural-Networks
The Minimal Fraud Detection project showcases the application of neural networks in detecting fraudulent activities within an extremely small dataset. Fraud poses a significant threat across various sectors, including finance, e-commerce, and insurance. This project focuses on leveraging neural network technology to detect fraud using limited data.

The neural network model utilized in this project is designed to learn patterns and features from the available data in order to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent instances. Despite the minimal dataset, the model demonstrates its ability to extract hidden patterns and make accurate predictions by leveraging interconnected layers of artificial neurons.

Despite the challenges posed by the minimal dataset, the results obtained from the Minimal Fraud Detection project provide valuable insights into the feasibility of using neural networks for fraud detection. The project aims to demonstrate the potential of neural networks as reliable tools for identifying fraudulent activities, even when working with extremely limited data.
